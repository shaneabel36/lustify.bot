## Basic Concepts

### What is a Library/Package?

Think of a library as a toolbox. Instead of building every tool yourself, you use pre-made tools.

**Example:**
```python
import requests  # This is like grabbing the "HTTP requests" toolbox
```

Common libraries in this project:
- **Flask**: Toolbox for building web servers
- **requests**: Toolbox for making HTTP requests
- **json**: Toolbox for working with JSON data

### What is an Environment?

An environment is like a separate workspace for your project. It keeps your project's tools separate from other projects.

**Why use it?**
- Different projects need different tool versions
- Keeps your computer organized
- Easy to share project requirements

**How to use:**
```bash
python -m venv venv        # Create environment
source venv/bin/activate   # Use environment (Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate      # Use environment (Windows)
```

### What is an API?

API = Application Programming Interface

Think of it like a restaurant:
- You (the customer) = Your code
- Menu = API documentation
- Waiter = API
- Kitchen = Venice AI servers

You order from the menu (make API request), waiter takes it to kitchen (sends to server), kitchen makes food (processes request), waiter brings it back (returns response).

## Python Concepts

### Classes and Objects

A **class** is like a blueprint. An **object** is a house built from that blueprint.

**Example from our code:**
```python
class VeniceClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
    
    def chat(self, messages):
        # Send messages to Venice AI
        pass
```

**Using it:**
```python
# Create an object (build a house from blueprint)
client = VeniceClient("my_api_key")

# Use the object (live in the house)
response = client.chat(["Hello"])
```

### Functions vs Methods

**Function**: Standalone piece of code
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"

greet("Alice")  # Call it directly
```

**Method**: Function that belongs to a class
```python
class Greeter:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello {name}"

g = Greeter()
g.greet("Alice")  # Call it on an object
```

### Imports

Imports bring code from other files into your current file.

```python
# Import entire module
import requests

# Import specific function
from flask import Flask

# Import with nickname
import requests as req
```

### Decorators

Decorators add functionality to functions. In Flask, they define routes.

```python
@app.route('/api/chat')  # This is a decorator
def chat():
    # This function runs when someone visits /api/chat
    pass
```

Think of it like: "When someone knocks on the '/api/chat' door, run this function"

## Web Development Concepts

### Client-Server Model

```
CLIENT (Browser)          SERVER (Flask)
     |                         |
     |  1. Request: "GET /"    |
     |------------------------>|
     |                         |
     |  2. Response: HTML      |
     |<------------------------|
     |                         |
```

### HTTP Methods

- **GET**: "Give me something" (like viewing a webpage)
- **POST**: "Here's some data, do something with it" (like submitting a form)

**Example:**
```python
@app.route('/api/chat', methods=['POST'])  # Only accept POST
def chat():
    data = request.json  # Get the data sent
    # Process it
    return jsonify(response)  # Send response back
```

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

JSON is a way to structure data that both humans and computers can read.

**Example:**
```json
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "hobbies": ["reading", "coding"]
}
```

**In Python:**
```python
import json

# Python dict to JSON string
data = {"name": "Alice"}
json_string = json.dumps(data)

# JSON string to Python dict
data = json.loads(json_string)
```

### Sessions

A session is like a shopping cart that follows you around a website.

```python
session['user_id'] = 123  # Store data
user_id = session.get('user_id')  # Retrieve data
```

---

## API Concepts

### REST API

REST = Representational State Transfer

It's a way to structure APIs using HTTP methods and URLs.

**Example:**
```
GET  /api/characters      â†’ Get list of characters
POST /api/chat            â†’ Send a chat message
POST /api/generate-image  â†’ Generate an image
```

### Request and Response

**Request** (what you send):
```python
{
    "message": "Hello",
    "character_slug": "character-name"
}
```

**Response** (what you get back):
```python
{
    "response": "Hi there!",
    "message_count": 5
}
```

### Authentication

Authentication proves who you are. We use a "Bearer Token" (API key).

```python
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}
```

Think of it like showing your ID card to enter a building.

## How to Modify the Code

### Change the AI's Personality

**File:** `app.py`, line 42

```python
system_prompt = """You are a flirty, playful AI companion..."""
```

Change this text to modify how the AI behaves.

### Change Image Settings

**File:** `src/venice_client.py`, line 120

```python
enhanced_prompt = f"{prompt}, 8K ultra high resolution, thigh high stockings..."
```

Modify what gets added to every image prompt.

**File:** `src/venice_client.py`, line 125

```python
payload = {
    "model": "lustify-sdxl",
    "width": 1024,  # Change image size
    "height": 1024,
    "steps": 30,    # Change quality (higher = better but slower)
}
```

### Change Colors/Styling

**File:** `static/style.css`

```css
/* Change gradient colors */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Change to different colors */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b6b 0%, #4ecdc4 100%);
```

### Add a New API Endpoint

**File:** `app.py`

```python
@app.route('/api/my-new-endpoint', methods=['POST'])
def my_new_function():
    data = request.json
    # Do something with data
    return jsonify({"result": "success"})
```

### Add a New Button

**File:** `templates/index.html`

```html
<button id="my-button" class="btn btn-primary">My Button</button>
```

**File:** `static/script.js`

```javascript
document.getElementById('my-button').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
    // Do something
});
```

## Common Patterns in the Code

### Pattern 1: Try-Except (Error Handling)

```python
try:
    # Try to do something that might fail
    response = requests.get(url)
except Exception as e:
    # If it fails, do this instead
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### Pattern 2: Async/Await (Not used here, but good to know)

```javascript
// JavaScript async function
async function sendMessage() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    const result = await response.json();
}
```

### Pattern 3: List Comprehension

```python
# Long way
adult_chars = []
for char in characters:
    if char.get("adult"):
        adult_chars.append(char)

# Short way (list comprehension)
adult_chars = [c for c in characters if c.get("adult")]
```

## Debugging Tips

### Print Statements

Add print statements to see what's happening:

```python
print(f"User message: {user_message}")
print(f"API response: {response}")
```

### Browser Console

Press F12 in your browser to see JavaScript errors and logs.

```javascript
console.log('This will show in browser console');
```

### Check API Responses

```python
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.json()}")
```

## Next Steps

1. **Read the code**: Start with `app.py` and follow the flow
2. **Make small changes**: Change colors, text, or prompts
3. **Add features**: Try adding a new button or endpoint
4. **Break things**: Don't be afraid to experiment!
5. **Use print statements**: See what's happening at each step

Remember: Every programmer started where you are. The best way to learn is by doing!
